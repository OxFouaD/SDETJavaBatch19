What are variables?
      variables are like containers that we use to store data in our programs.

what are DataTypes?
      DataTypes are used to store and identify different type of data in variables.

Primitive dataTypes:
  There are 8 basic dataTypes in java.
     btye => the extra smallest whole number box.
     short => the small whole number box.
     int => the medium whole number box.
     long => the extra large whole number box.
     float => small container for decimal numbers, (l a3dad li fihom fasila bhal 2.3 w dima ndiro moraha F)
     double => medium container fir decimal numbers, (l a3dad li fihom fasila b joj ar9am awla kter bhal 2.322 )
     char => smallest datatype for storing the characters (only 1 character west '')
     boolean => store true or false.

Non-primitive dataTypes:
    Are advance dataTypes built using the above mentioned 8 primitive dataTypes.

=====================================================================================

How do we decide what dataType we should use for a variable?
    we decide based on two things one is what type of data we are planing to store.
    and second what type of operations we will be performing on that data.
